# Changelog

All notable changes to the PyPI package for SWE-bench ([`swebench`](https://pypi.org/project/swebench/)) will be documented in this file.

Prior to version 1.1.0, not all deployed versions are listed, as the PyPI package was going through development and testing. The noteworthy versions and the respective changes that were introduced by that version are included. All versions 1.1.0 onwards are fully listed.

## [Unreleased]

Breaking changes:
* The run report is written to `logs/evaluation/<run_id>/results.json` instead of
  `<model>.<run_id>.json` in the current directory. `--report_dir` / `--report-dir` is
  gone: the report always sits with the run's other artifacts.
* `RUN_VALIDATION_LOG_DIR` is gone. Nothing read it, and the `run_validation.sh` the
  collection docs mention does not exist in this repository.
* Evaluation logs are written to `logs/evaluation/<run_id>` instead of
  `logs/run_evaluation/<run_id>`. Move an existing directory to keep past runs
  readable by `swebench report` and `swebench submit package`:
  `mv logs/run_evaluation logs/evaluation`.

Added:
* `swebench infer` runs mini-SWE-agent over a dataset, writing predictions and
  trajectories to `logs/inference/<run_id>`.
* `swebench submit package|publish|register|verify` build and check a leaderboard
  submission, and `swebench submit hf` publishes to a HuggingFace bucket.

## [5.0.1] - 8/17/2026

Fixed:
* A task's Dockerfile can `COPY` from its own `tasks/<instance_id>/` directory, so a task that needs a file at build time can carry it next to the Dockerfile that reads it. `ImageSpec` gained a `context_dir`, and `swebench.task.repo.task_paths` maps each instance to its build context.

## [5.0.0] - 8/17/2026

Breaking changes:
* Task repos hold one directory per instance under `tasks/`, and a `sweb.yaml` naming the dataset they publish. Task metadata is split by kind: `task.yaml` for the short fields, `tests.json` for FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS, `problem_statement.md` and `hints.md` for prose. The harness reads that tree directly: `swebench dataset build|check|diff|push` and `swebench images build|check|push` all take a task repo path as their only argument, so a command can no longer be pointed at one dataset while fed another repo.
* `--assets_dir` is gone. Binary patch assets come from `tasks/<instance_id>/assets/`, and no longer need a url.
* Dataset aliases are now `full`, `verified`, `multilingual` and `multimodal`. Any other name, including a full HuggingFace id, is used as given.
* `prepare_images.main()` takes `task_repo` instead of `dataset_name` and `split`.
* `--dockerfile-repo` and `SWEBENCH_DOCKERFILE_REPOS` are gone; use `--task-repo`. `swebench.collect.build_local_datasets` is removed, since `swebench dataset build` compiles from a task repo.
* A task repo can publish several datasets: `sweb.yaml` names them all, each task lists the ones it belongs to, and `-d/--dataset` narrows any build, diff, push or image command. Verified and Lite are subsets of the same instances rather than copies of them.
* Task repo code moved into `swebench.task`: `swebench.task.repo`, `swebench.task.checks`, `swebench.task.publish`.
* Removed `swebench.constants`, which nothing imported.
* `swebench.versioning` moved out of this repo, to [swe-bench-tasks/src/versioning](https://github.com/SWE-bench/swe-bench-tasks/tree/main/src/versioning). It builds datasets rather than running them, and only works for the original Python repos. The `swebench dataset versions` command and seven `swebench.*` version helpers are gone with it.
* Names in the `swebench` namespace are now loaded on first use. Everything importable before still is, but `import swebench` no longer pulls in bs4, docker, datasets and modal.
* Datasets carry their own `eval_script` and metadata, so the harness no longer needs a Dockerfile repo checkout to evaluate.
* Image building moved to `swebench.image_builder`, with an `ImageSpec` that supports amd64 and arm64. `TestSpec` now assumes images already exist.
* Committed dataset parquets removed. HuggingFace is the source of truth.

Added:
* A run records the dataset and split it graded against, in `logs/run_evaluation/<run_id>/run.json`, so `swebench report <run_id>` no longer needs `-d`. Runs made before this still need it.
* A `swebench` CLI, with grouped commands and worked examples in the help text.
* SWE-bench Multimodal test-split support, including its log parsers and image assets. `--assets_dir` loads binary assets from disk when a URL has gone stale.

Fixed grading:
* A patch can no longer pass by printing its own `PASSED` lines. The eval script records the test command's exit code, and a log claiming no failures while the tests failed is not graded (#620).
* A run with no results and no sign the suite ran is rejected rather than scored as resolved.
* Infrastructure failures are labelled in the report, without being removed from the score (#586).
* Truncated parametrized test ids, skipped tests, results outside the output markers, and test names containing spaces are all handled.
* `report_dir` is honored; reports no longer land in the checkout.

## [0.6.9 - 0.6.9.2] - 3/31/2024 
> ⚠️ Do NOT use these versions. The PyPI package for these versions was under development. Specifically, some of the evaluation configurations required re-validation. A detailed report for the failures and our recovery from it are detailed in [Bug Report 4/5/2024](docs/reports/20240405_eval_bug/README.md).

## [0.6.1] - 3/14/2023
* Added minor conditions to make `run_evaluation` more robust (e.g. exit on empty predictions)
* Added logic that conditions conda link download based on which architecture/platform (e.g. x86, arm) the code is being run on.
* Added classes to unify `subprocess` execution arguments + make them more consistent throughout the codebase. Also remove `shell=True` flag when not necessary.
* Added deterministic hashing of model name when creating certain testbed paths, defends against https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/12250
* Fixed key errors across the `metrics/` folder.
* Reorganized `harness` code. Moved constants into a separate file to improve readability.

## [0.4.8] - 11/8/2023
* `run_evaluation` can be imported to make running the evaluation harness of SWE-bench more accessible.
* Add condition in `harness/context_manager.py` to skip installation if no instructions are provided.
* Add functionality to check and remove logs with `AttributeError` or `ImportError`
* Add support for HumanEval dataset.
* Add support for relative paths for `log_dir` and `testbed` arguments of evaluation.
* Minor renaming for `metrics/report.py` variables.

## [0.4.3] - 11/5/2023
Introducing the initial release of SWE-Bench, a novel benchmark that introduces "software engineering as a task". Given a codebase and an issue, a model is tasked with writing a `.patch` file that addresses the desired changes.

Please view the `README.md` for information on how to run the repository, and check out our paper, [SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770), for full details on the project.

We will maintain a leaderboard on the SWE-bench public [website](http://swe-bench.github.io). We will release details soon on how to submit your generations for evaluation to be included on the leaderboard.

## [< 0.4.3] - 11/4/2023
> ⚠️ Do NOT use these versions. The PyPI package was under development for these versions and will not work properly.
