"""Turn a finished evaluation run into a leaderboard submission.

A submission is two trees, because the heavy artifacts and the leaderboard entry live
in different places:

    submission-repo/        the submitter's own public GitHub repo
      all_preds.jsonl
      logs/<iid>/{patch.diff,report.json,test_output.txt[.gz]}
      trajs/<iid>.*
    entry/                  the PR to github.com/SWE-bench/experiments
      metadata.yaml
      README.md
      results/{results.json,resolved_by_repo.json,resolved_by_time.json}
      per_instance_details.json    (multilingual)

``logs/`` mirrors what the S3 bucket has always held, so existing consumers
(``analysis/download_logs.py``, the site's log links) keep working against a repo.

Resolution is **re-derived** here, never read from the run's own ``report.json``: each
instance is re-graded from its ``test_output.txt`` against the dataset, the same way
``experiments/analysis/get_results.py`` has always done it. A submission that ships a
doctored report still scores from its logs.
