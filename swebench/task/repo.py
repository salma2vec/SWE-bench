"""Reading a task repo, the source of truth for a dataset's instances.

A task repo holds one directory per instance::

    sweb.yaml             the datasets this repo publishes, and their splits
    tasks/<instance_id>/
        task.yaml             short metadata, including which split the task is in
        tests.json            the tests that decide whether a patch resolved it
        problem_statement.md  the issue text shown to a model
        hints.md              discussion from the issue, absent when there is none
        gold.patch            the reference fix
        test.patch            the tests that grade it
        eval.sh               the script the harness runs
        Dockerfile            the image it runs in
        test_assets/          binary files a patch cannot carry, staged at eval time
        problem_assets/       what the problem statement links to, archived so it
                              cannot rot; the harness never reads these

Nothing here consults HuggingFace: a task repo can rebuild its dataset alone,
which is what makes local development of a new dataset possible.
