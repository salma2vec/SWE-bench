"""Results emitted outside the START/END markers must still be graded (#402).

`set -x` traces the marker no-ops to stderr, so depending on how a runner
interleaves stdout and stderr the results can land outside them. Slicing then
yields nothing and the run looks resultless -- fastlane__fastlane-21857 in
SWE-bench_Multilingual fails this way (208 chars inside the markers, 3 real
results outside them).
