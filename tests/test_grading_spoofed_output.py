"""A patch must not be able to pass by printing its own PASSED lines (#620).

The eval script records the test command's exit status, and grading refuses to
score a log that claims no failures while the tests exited non-zero.

The status to record is the *test command's*, not the eval script's: scripts end
with a `git checkout` that resets the test files and run without `set -e`, so the
script's own status is the reset's. Getting that wrong both misses the spoof (the
reset usually succeeds, hiding a failing test run) and rejects genuine all-pass
runs whose reset fails, which is the case for every test patch that creates a new
test file.
